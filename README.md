Modeling the world of an african savannah with animals and vegetation
Wanted to make a tile based map that simulated some animals and them moving around with hunter-prey
relationships. Right now just have plant eaters and they move randomly.

Added memory for herbrivores for plants and water. Added A* Pathfinding to find the fastest route to those areas if there 
is nothing in site. The animals will now die if they don't get anough food or water in a certain amount of rounds.
Added an abstract factory design for adding the animai class and a strategy pattern for the behavior. Have another window that
shows the number of animals on the screen.
